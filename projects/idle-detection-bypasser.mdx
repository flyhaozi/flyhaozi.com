## Idle Detection Bypasser
This userscript will give a fake active response to the caller of the Idle Detection API.
Normally, you don't have to use this script because you can deny the permission request directly.
You only need this script when the website refuses to provide service without the permission.

## Example - An online learning timer
Use this example to check if the userscript works. The timer won't pause after enabling this userscript.
